// .dev/floor/command-hygiene.test.mjs — the guard that keeps `lessons-learned.md` L19 closed.
//
// WHY IT LIVES HERE, with no paired checker (GRILL F4). Every other `*.test.mjs` under `.dev/floor/`
// tests a sibling `.mjs` checker. This one tests COMMAND PROSE instead, because the thing it guards is a
// shell invocation embedded in markdown — there is no checker to pair with, and inventing one for a
// single regex would be the speculative addition P7 forbids. It sits here because `.dev/floor/` is where
// the repo's deterministic apparatus lives, and it runs under the same `npm test` glob as everything else.
//
// WHAT IT GUARDS (L19). fix #7 gates `Write|Edit|MultiEdit` only, so a tool a stage invokes through Bash
// writes wherever it likes. `/pharn-dev-build`'s Step 2b used to prescribe `npm run format` — which is
// `prettier --write .`, the WHOLE REPO — while its own prose said "the just-written files". It silently
// reformatted files no plan had declared. This asserts no stage command re-acquires that habit.
//
// ── Honest scope (P0) — what this does and does NOT buy ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// FLOOR (what a green run means): none of the KNOWN repo-wide write invocations appears as a prescribed
//   command in `.claude/commands/*.md`.
// NOT guaranteed: that no repo-wide write can happen. This pins a VOCABULARY, not a behavior — a novel
//   spelling (a new npm script, a shell alias, a different tool) passes untouched. It is a negative
//   assertion over known-bad strings, never a proof of absence, and it does NOT close L19's class: any
//   Bash-invoked tool still escapes the writes-scope entirely. Removing one instance is not closing a door.
//
// Non-LLM, stdlib-only.
